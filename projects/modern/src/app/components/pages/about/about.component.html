          <p class="text-lg mb-3">
            Carry, Inc. (or simply Carry) is a shipping/transportation as a service platform, allowing users to become their own shipping/transportation provider similar to UPS, FedEx, etc. 
            A user can request an item to be transported from one location to another; another user of the platform can fulfill that request.
          </p>

          <p class="text-3xl mb-2">Why Carry?</p>
          <p class="text-lg mb-2">
            Carry seeks to provide the speed and efficiency of moving items by leveraging available people in the community via the convenience of a platform, 
            readily accessible on your smartphone. Some of the core scenarios Carry want to address:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You left something somewhere and you don't want to make a trip to get it and another trip to come back</li>
            <li>You need something taken somewhere but don't have the time to do it</li>
            <li>You ordered something online in the same city as you and don't want to wait for days via UPS or FedEx or even Amazon next day delivery</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-lg mb-3">
            Essentially, Carry is a new community-based item/package shipping and transportation option. 
            The goal is to create another self-employment option as a transportation service provider, giving people another delivery option for a faster and more direct delivery of items.
